# Minesweeper
The classic game, with difficulty levels designed after the google difficulty standard

## Current Status
  The game is essentially finished. The user is able to play the game in full through the terminal with fleshed out difficulty options.

## ToDo's
1. Create Necessary Classes
   - ~Create a Hardcoded Setup~
       - ~Board Generates~
       - ~Board Prints~
   - ~Update from Hardcoded Setup~
       - ~Update the function that generates the board to place bombs randombly on the board~
       - ~Update the function that generates the board to set individual Square values properly~
       - ~Update the print function to adjust as need be based on boardsize/difficulty level~
3. GUI
